    "The time domain representation of each window function shows the symmetry, which guarantees a linear phase. If we evaluate the fourier-transform of the window functions to analyze the filter behavior, principally we could come out with a statement, with a rising order $m$, the spectrum is proportionally buckling. Therefore, the pass band[1] $\\Omega < \\Omega_s$ is reduced accordingly with an increment from $m=21$ to $m=42$. The stop band behavior ($\\Omega \\rightarrow \\pi$) validates that it is better if the filter order is higher. If the attenuation of the first shot is considered, it shows an attenuation independent from $m$ w.g. $a_N \\approx 57 \\, \\textrm{dB}$, by Blackman window.  \n",
    "A comparison between the windows verifies a compromise between the achievable pass band and the attenuation of the first overshot. While the rectangular window has the smallest pass band of $2\\pi/(m+1)$ and the lowest attenuation of $a_N \\approx 13.3 \\, \\textrm{dB}$, the Blackman window has the widest pass band of $6\\pi/(m+1)$, but at the same time it also has the highest attenuation of the first overshot.  \n",

    "**b)** The following figures show the time domain plots and the Fourier transform of the Kaiser window for values $\\beta = 0, 3, 6$ with a window length of $m=21$. For $\\beta=0$, the Kaiser window corresponds to the rectangular window and has therefore the smallest pass band for this parameter option, but also the lowest first overshot attenuation. An increment of $\\beta$ at a constant filter order improves the attenuation behavior and at the same time, the pass band would be wider. With the help of the free parameter $\\beta$, a compromise between the pass band and the attenuation behavior could be found. A complete description of the Kaiser window is shown in table 5.4.\n",
