There are Python-functions e.g. `butter`, `cheby1` etc. to realize a lowpass design for continuous time systems. The tolerance scheme given in the z domain has to be transformed to the s domain, the existing algorithms are used to design the desired filter in the s domain, then the system function is transformed back to the z domain.  \n",

Using the bilinear transformation, a predistortion of the $\\Omega$-axis in the z domain is necessary. The design may be done using the standard procedures described in Section 4.2.2 and 4.2.3 using an auxiliary function.  \n",
