    "#### Task 1: window functions\n",
    "In contrast to a recursive filter, whose design is based on the transformation of continuous time IIR-Systems to discrete time IIR-systems, the design of non recursive (FIT) systems is based on the approximation of the desired frequency response of the discrete time system. Due to their constant group delay, mostly _linear phase_ filters are applied, whose design is treated in the following text.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIR systems with linear phase are based on windowing with ideal low-pass-filters. To keep the linear phase constraint the window functions have to be symmetric.  \n",

    "\n",
    "By varying $m$ and $\\beta$ the length and the shape of the window may be varied to each a compromise between the amplitude of the first overshot and the width of the main maximum.

Antisymmetric filters (type II and IV) may be designed by an additional argument to the function `firpm()`. For differentiators, this is done by using the string `d: b=firpm(m,F,G,'d')` (additionally an optimal weighting `W` may be applied). Design a differentiator of task **4.a** as a type II and IV and compare the absolute values of the transfer function and the impulse responses.\n",
