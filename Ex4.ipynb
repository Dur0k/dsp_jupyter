    "#### Task 1: window functions\n",
    "In contrast to a recursive filter, whose design is based on the transformation of continuous time IIR-Systems to discrete time IIR-systems, the design of non recursive (FIT) systems is based on the approximation of the desired frequency response of the discrete time system. Due to their constant group delay, mostly _linear phase_ filters are applied, whose design is treated in the following text.\n",
    "\n",
    "FIR systems with linear phase are based on windowing with ideal low-pass-filters. To keep the linear phase constraint the window functions have to be symmetric.  \n",
    "The most common window functions are the so-called cosine windows, which have the following form:\n",

    "\n",
    "By varying $m$ and $\\beta$ the length and the shape of the window may be varied to each a compromise between the amplitude of the first overshot and the width of the main maximum.
